# REACT Job Listing App

Getting my feet wet with a full-stack job board CRUD application built with React and Node.js. This is a simple app that allows you to create, read, update, and delete job listings. Materials and content were provided by [Traversy Media on GitHub.](https://github.com/bradtraversy/job-listing-react-nodejs) This is the jobs listing project from the [YouTube crash course](https://youtu.be/LDB4uaJ87e0).
